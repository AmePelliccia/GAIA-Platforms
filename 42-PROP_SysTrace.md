# SysTrace â€“ PROPulsion Systems (42-PROP)

Traceability documentation for GAIA-AIR propulsion components.

## Traceability Matrix
| Requirement | Design ID | Test Case | Verification Status |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-42-001  | DES-4201  | TC-4201   | Pending             |

*(Populate as documentation progresses.)*

## Overview

The SysTrace documentation provides a comprehensive traceability matrix for propulsion systems within the GAIA-AIR division. This document ensures that all requirements, design elements, and test cases are thoroughly tracked and verified, maintaining the highest standards of quality and compliance.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

1. Provide a clear and structured traceability matrix for propulsion systems.
2. Ensure that all requirements are linked to their corresponding design elements and test cases.
3. Track the verification status of each requirement to ensure compliance and quality.

## Scope

This document covers all propulsion systems within the GAIA-AIR division, including:

- Design specifications
- Test cases
- Verification and validation processes

## Methodology

The traceability matrix is maintained using the following methodology:

1. **Requirement Identification:** Each requirement is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., REQ-42-001).
2. **Design Mapping:** Each requirement is mapped to its corresponding design element (e.g., DES-4201).
3. **Test Case Association:** Each design element is associated with one or more test cases (e.g., TC-4201).
4. **Verification Tracking:** The verification status of each requirement is tracked and updated as testing progresses.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **System Engineers:** Responsible for defining and documenting requirements.
- **Design Engineers:** Responsible for creating design elements that meet the requirements.
- **Test Engineers:** Responsible for developing and executing test cases.
- **Quality Assurance:** Responsible for verifying and validating the requirements, design elements, and test cases.

## Tools and Resources

The following tools and resources are used to maintain the traceability matrix:

- **Requirement Management Tool:** Used to document and track requirements.
- **Design Documentation:** Used to capture design elements and their mappings to requirements.
- **Test Management Tool:** Used to develop, execute, and track test cases.
- **Verification Reports:** Used to document the verification status of each requirement.

## Conclusion

The SysTrace documentation is a critical component of the GAIA-AIR division's quality assurance process. By maintaining a comprehensive traceability matrix, we ensure that all propulsion system requirements are thoroughly tracked, verified, and validated, maintaining the highest standards of quality and compliance.
