# COAFI – Event Handlers System Specification

This document specifies the modules and logic responsible for handling specific events that trigger actions within the COAFI orchestration engine. These handlers act as the reactive component of COAFI, allowing it to respond dynamically to changes and external stimuli within the GAIA Platforms ecosystem.

---

## Purpose & Functionality

The core purpose of the Event Handlers is to define how COAFI reacts to various triggers, initiating appropriate workflows and ensuring system coherence. They manage the detection, parsing, and routing of events to the correct processing logic.

---

## Specific Trigger Handling

### Git Commits/Merges in Monitored Repositories
- **Detection**:  
  COAFI monitors designated Git repositories for new commits or merges affecting tracked files (e.g., specification documents, configuration files).
- **Action**:  
  Upon detection, the relevant handler (e.g., `GitCommitHandler`) parses the changes and initiates appropriate workflows, such as:
  - Validating the changed content against defined schemas (`COAFI/Schema/`).
  - Triggering automated documentation generation or updates (`COAFI/Generators/`).
  - Notifying dependent systems or updating COAFI registries (`COAFI/Registries/`).
  - Logging the change event via BITT.

---

### API Calls to COAFI Endpoints
- **Detection**:  
  COAFI exposes APIs (`COAFI/Interfaces/API_Definitions/`) for external systems or users to interact with its functions (e.g., query registries, submit new information).
- **Action**:  
  The `APIRequestHandler` validates incoming requests (authentication, payload schema) and executes the corresponding action, which might involve:
  - Querying or updating COAFI registries.
  - Initiating specific orchestration workflows (`COAFI/Workflows/`).
  - Returning data to the caller.
  - Logging the API interaction via BITT.

---

### Events Logged in the BITT Ledger
- **Detection**:  
  COAFI can monitor the BITT ledger for specific, predefined event types logged by other GAIA components (e.g., compliance failures, critical system alerts, completion of milestones).
- **Action**:  
  The `BITTEventHandler` filters and processes relevant BITT events, triggering actions like:
  - Generating notifications to relevant stakeholders.
  - Initiating automated remediation or escalation workflows.
  - Updating the status of related items within COAFI registries.

---

### Messages Received via Federated Communication Channels
- **Detection**:  
  COAFI listens on designated secure communication channels (potentially using protocols defined in `Domains/AERO/INTERFACE/Data-Control-Interfaces/` or `Domains/SPACE/INTERFACE/`) for messages from other federated GAIA domains or systems.
- **Action**:  
  Handlers parse incoming messages, verify authenticity, and initiate workflows based on the message content and source domain. This enables cross-domain coordination and data synchronization orchestrated by COAFI.

---

### Scheduled Tasks or Time-Based Triggers
- **Detection**:  
  An internal scheduler within the `COAFI/Engine/` triggers predefined tasks at specific times or intervals.
- **Action**:  
  Handlers execute routine tasks such as:
  - Generating periodic compliance or status reports.
  - Performing system health checks on COAFI itself.
  - Running data aggregation or cleanup workflows.
  - Archiving old registry entries according to `COAFI/Policies/`.

---

## Detailed Considerations

### Specifications

#### Event Detection
- Define the specific event types to monitor (e.g., Git commits on `.md`, `.spec` files; API POST requests to `/registry/update`; BITT events matching pattern `GAIA:COMPLIANCE:*`; federated messages of type `SystemUpdateNotification`; daily scheduled task `GenerateReport`).
- Specify the exact sources (e.g., list of repository URLs/paths, specific API endpoint routes, BITT event topics/smart contract addresses, message queue names, cron expressions for scheduled tasks).

#### Event Routing
- Maintain a central routing map (e.g., in a configuration file like `handler_routes.yaml` or a dedicated registry) associating event types/sources with specific handler modules/classes (e.g., `GitCommitEvent -> handlers.git.GitCommitHandler`).

#### Workflow Initiation
- Define the specific workflow(s) (from `COAFI/Workflows/`) triggered by each handler upon successful event processing.
- Specify required inputs for each workflow (e.g., commit hash, changed file list, API payload, BITT event data).
- Document workflow dependencies and potential chaining (Workflow A completion triggers Event B handled by Handler C).

#### Integration Points
- Clearly document API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI specifications in `COAFI/Interfaces/API_Definitions/`).
- Define standardized message formats for federated communication channels.
- Specify authentication and authorization requirements for API endpoints and message sources.

---

### Implementation Details

#### Code Structure
- Organize handlers logically within `COAFI/Engine/Event_Handlers/` (e.g., `git_handlers.py`, `api_handlers.py`, `bitt_handlers.py`).
- Implement a central event dispatcher/listener service that monitors sources and routes events based on the defined mapping.
- Consider using an event bus or message queue internally for decoupling.

#### Handler Logic
- Define a common base class or interface for all handlers (e.g., an abstract `BaseEventHandler` with an `async handle_event(event_data)` method).
- Implement specific parsing, validation, and processing logic within each concrete handler class.
- Utilize shared utility modules for logging, configuration access, BITT interaction, etc.

#### Data Flow
- Define standardized internal event objects/data structures passed between the dispatcher and handlers.
- Implement robust parsing and validation (e.g., using Pydantic models) for incoming event payloads.

#### Dependencies
- Use dependency injection frameworks or patterns to provide handlers with access to external services (BITT client, Git API client, Workflow engine client, Database client).
- Develop mock implementations of these dependencies for effective unit and integration testing.

---

### Specific Error Handling Logic

#### Validation Errors
- Log detailed validation failures (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types) with event context.
- For API requests, return standardized error responses (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) with clear error messages.
- For other event types, potentially log to a specific error queue or notify an administrator.

#### Processing Failures
- Implement configurable retry mechanisms (e.g., using libraries like `tenacity`) with exponential backoff for transient issues (e.g., temporary network errors, database deadlocks).
- Log detailed errors including stack traces and relevant event data for debugging.
- Define a maximum retry limit, after which the event is moved to a dead-letter queue or triggers a critical failure alert.

#### Unrecognized Events
- Log unrecognized or unroutable events clearly, indicating the source and payload.
- Avoid discarding silently; move to an "unprocessed" queue or log for later analysis.

#### Critical Failures
- Define specific error conditions considered critical (e.g., inability to connect to BITT, unrecoverable database errors, consistent workflow initiation failures).
- Trigger automated escalation workflows: send alerts to monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager), notify administrators via email/chatops.

#### Audit and Traceability
- Ensure every significant step (event received, validation success/failure, handler invoked, workflow initiated, processing success/failure, retries) is logged immutably to BITT, correlated with the original event and relevant UTidS identifiers.
