# COAFI - Event Handlers

This directory contains the modules and logic responsible for handling specific events that trigger actions within the COAFI orchestration engine. These handlers act as the reactive component of COAFI, allowing it to respond dynamically to changes and external stimuli within the GAIA Platforms ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

- To define how COAFI reacts to triggers such as:
  - Git commits/merges in monitored repositories.
  - API calls to COAFI endpoints.
  - Events logged in the BITT ledger.
  - Messages received via federated communication channels.
  - Scheduled tasks or time-based triggers.
- To initiate specific COAFI workflows based on the detected event type and context.
- To parse event payloads and extract relevant data for processing.
- To manage error handling and logging for event processing.

## Examples of Handlers

1. **GitCommitHandler**:  
   Detects changes to specification documents and triggers validation or documentation generation workflows.

2. **BITTEventHandler**:  
   Monitors the BITT ledger for specific compliance events and triggers notification or remediation workflows.

3. **APIRequestHandler**:  
   Handles incoming requests to update or query COAFI registries.
