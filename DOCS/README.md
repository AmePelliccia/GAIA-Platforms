# GAIA Software Roadmap

## Proposed Future Integrations

The following integrations are proposed to enhance GAIA Software's capabilities:

### Core Quantum Infrastructure & Platforms

- **Quantum Simulators**: Integrate and benchmark simulators like Qiskit Aer, Cirq Simulator, ProjectQ, QuTiP, Quantinuum InQuanto, Amazon Braket Simulators, Keysight PathWave. Develop a unified interface.
- **Quantum Computing Platforms**: Develop connectors/SDKs for platforms like Cirq, PennyLane, Braket, Azure Quantum. Facilitate circuit translation and job submission. Consider OpenQASM 3.0.
- **Quantum Compilers**: Integrate compilers like Qiskit's transpiler and Tket for circuit optimization.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: (Long-term goal) Design a standard interface for interacting with diverse quantum hardware types.

### Quantum Algorithms, Libraries & Error Correction

- **Quantum Algorithm Libraries**: Integrate libraries like Qiskit Algorithms, PennyLane templates, and OpenFermion. Provide wrappers and examples.
- **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)**: Integrate QEC codes (e.g., repetition, Steane, surface codes) and decoders. Provide simulation tools.

### Application Domains

- **Quantum Chemistry**: Integrate packages like OpenFermion and PySCF. Implement algorithms (VQE, UCCSD) and visualization.
- **Quantum Finance**: Develop features using tools like Quantinuum InQuanto or open-source libraries for portfolio optimization, risk management, etc.
- **Quantum Optimization**: Integrate libraries like Qiskit Optimization and D-Wave Ocean SDK for combinatorial optimization problems.

### Supporting Technologies & Cloud

- **Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure**: Offer seamless deployment and management on AWS (Braket), Azure Quantum, and potentially Google Cloud.
- **Data Science & ML Tools**: Support integration with PyTorch Quantum, JAX, and other specialized ML libraries.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**: Integrate NIST-selected PQC algorithms (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium).
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: (Longer-term goal) Explore integration with QKD systems.

### Developer Ecosystem

- **Developer Tools & Ecosystem**: Improve IDE support (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter), documentation, tutorials, and build a community forum/channel.

### Suggested Prioritization

The initial focus suggested is on:

1. Quantum Simulators (Integration #1)
2. Quantum Computing Platforms (Integration #2 - Cirq, PennyLane first)
3. Quantum Algorithm Libraries (Integration #5)
4. Quantum Error Correction (Integration #6)
5. Developer Ecosystem (Integration #14 - Documentation/Tutorials first)

The remaining items are considered important but can potentially be addressed in later phases.
