## Introduction

Welcome to the **GAIA-SPACE** division, a key area within the broader **GAIA Platforms** initiative. This division focuses specifically on the application of GAIA principles and technologies to interplanetary exploration and transportation, encompassing spacecraft, habitats, propulsion systems, and related infrastructure.

Our mission within the GAIA-SPACE division is to foster the development and integration of sustainable, safe, efficient, and intelligent solutions for space exploration and transportation, leveraging the core GAIA frameworks like COAFI, InaC, and BITT.

## Purpose & Scope

The primary purpose of the GAIA-SPACE division is to orchestrate projects, define standards, and manage specifications related to space systems, operations, and supporting infrastructure within the GAIA ecosystem.

The scope includes:

* **Interplanetary Exploration:** Development and integration of systems for interplanetary missions, including spacecraft, habitats, propulsion systems, and mission planning.
* **Orbital Services:** Planning and implementation of orbital services, including satellite deployment, maintenance, and deorbiting.
* **Sustainable Space Operations:** Initiatives focused on sustainable space operations, including debris mitigation, resource utilization, and environmental stewardship.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring all systems and specifications align with relevant space agencies and international standards.

## Key Subdirectories & Areas

This directory is structured to house specific projects and specifications related to different aspects of space exploration and transportation:

* **/INTERPLANETARY**: Focuses on systems and specifications for interplanetary missions.
* **/ORBITAL_SERVICES**: Projects and research focused specifically on orbital services and satellite operations.
* **/SUSTAINABILITY**: Documentation and processes related to sustainable space operations and environmental stewardship.

## Core Principles Alignment

The GAIA-SPACE division adheres strictly to the overarching GAIA Platforms principles, with a particular emphasis on:

* **Safety:** Uncompromising adherence to the highest safety standards and certifications.
* **Sustainability:** Driving innovation in sustainable space operations, debris mitigation, and resource utilization.
* **Efficiency:** Optimizing mission planning, spacecraft operations, and resource utilization through data integration and AI.
* **Traceability & Compliance:** Full integration with COAFI for documentation management and BITT for auditable compliance records.
* **Federation:** Ensuring seamless interoperability with other GAIA domains (GP-COM, GP-SUPL, GP-GRO) and external space stakeholders.

## Contribution & Development

We welcome contributions to the GAIA-SPACE division. To contribute:

* Familiarize yourself with the existing projects and specifications in the relevant subdirectories.
* Follow the GAIA Platforms' standard Git workflow: fork the repository, create a clear feature branch, and submit pull requests with comprehensive descriptions.
* Engage actively through issue trackers and discussions to ensure alignment on technical standards, space regulations, and best practices.
* For questions, detailed collaboration, or specific domain insights, contact the GAIA-SPACE division maintainers or utilize the official GAIA Platforms communication channels outlined in the main README.
