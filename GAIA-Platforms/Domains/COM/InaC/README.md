# GAIA Platforms - Infrastructural Code (InaC)

## Introduction

Welcome to the **InaC (Infrastructural Code)** framework, a core component within the **GP-COM (Common Services & Communications)** domain of the GAIA Platforms initiative. InaC focuses on the declarative, ethically-aware management of infrastructure as code, ensuring that all infrastructure components are deployed, configured, and managed in a consistent, secure, and sustainable manner.

## Purpose & Scope

The primary purpose of InaC is to provide a robust, reliable, and ethically-aware framework for managing infrastructure across the GAIA Platforms initiative. This includes:

* **Declarative Infrastructure Management:** Defining infrastructure as code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
* **Ethical Governance:** Embedding ethical considerations and constraints directly into the infrastructure code.
* **Traceability & Auditability:** Leveraging the COAFI and BITT systems to provide end-to-end traceability and immutable audit trails.
* **Federation & Interoperability:** Ensuring seamless integration and interoperability across diverse GAIA domains.

## Key Components

* **Declarative Engine:** Parses InaC definitions and ensures the desired state is achieved.
* **State Manager:** Maintains the perceived state of managed resources.
* **Orchestration Engine:** Plans and executes actions to reconcile state.
* **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Evaluates actions and configurations against defined policies.
* **COAFI Interface:** Integrates with the Canonical Orchestrated Architecture File Index for traceability.
* **BITT Logger:** Commits audit records to the Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust ledger.
* **Resource Adapters:** Plugins for interacting with specific infrastructure types.
* **Federation Gateway:** Manages communication and policy synchronization across federated domains.

## Contribution & Development

We welcome contributions to the InaC framework. To contribute:

* Review the existing documentation and code in the relevant subdirectories.
* Follow the standard Git workflow: fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
* Engage with maintainers through issues and discussions to align on architecture, coding standards, and best practices.
* For questions, collaboration, or detailed discussions, please reach out via the official GAIA Platforms communication channels listed in the repository's main README or contact the domain maintainers directly.
