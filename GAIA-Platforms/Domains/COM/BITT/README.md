# GAIA Platforms - Blockchain Integrated Traceability and Trust (BITT)

## Introduction

Welcome to the **BITT (Blockchain Integrated Traceability and Trust)** framework, a core component within the **GP-COM (Common Services & Communications)** domain of the GAIA Platforms initiative. BITT focuses on leveraging blockchain technology to provide immutable traceability and trust for all infrastructure components and actions within the GAIA ecosystem.

## Purpose & Scope

The primary purpose of BITT is to ensure the integrity, transparency, and auditability of all actions and configurations managed by the GAIA Platforms initiative. This includes:

* **Immutable Audit Trails:** Leveraging blockchain technology to create tamper-proof records of all infrastructure changes and policy enforcement actions.
* **Traceability:** Providing end-to-end traceability for all infrastructure components and actions, ensuring compliance with defined policies and standards.
* **Trust:** Establishing a foundation of trust through verifiable, immutable records of all actions and configurations.

## Key Components

* **Blockchain Ledger:** The core component of BITT, providing the immutable, distributed ledger for recording all actions and configurations.
* **Smart Contracts:** Automating policy enforcement, SLA management, and other critical functions through blockchain-based smart contracts.
* **Identity Management:** Leveraging decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for secure, verifiable identities of resources and agents interacting with BITT.
* **Integration with COAFI:** Ensuring seamless integration with the Canonical Orchestrated Architecture File Index for traceability and auditability.

## Contribution & Development
