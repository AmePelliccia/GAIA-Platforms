# GAIA Platforms - Common Services & Communications Domain (GP-COM)

## Overview

Welcome to the **GP-COM (Common Services & Communications)** domain, a foundational pillar within the GAIA Platforms initiative. GP-COM serves as the central hub for shared infrastructure, core services, communication protocols, and overarching governance frameworks that enable the seamless operation and federation of all other GAIA Platform domains (e.g., GP-AM, GP-AS, GP-GRO, GP-SUPL, GP-RAME).

This domain is responsible for designing, deploying, managing, and evolving the essential digital fabric that connects and supports the diverse activities across the GAIA ecosystem, ensuring consistency, security, compliance, and interoperability.

## Purpose & Scope

The primary purpose of GP-COM is to provide robust, reliable, and ethically-aware common services and infrastructure components, reducing redundancy and fostering collaboration across the GAIA Platforms initiative.

The scope of GP-COM includes, but is not limited to:

* **Core Infrastructure Management:** Hosting and managing the **Infrastructural Code (InaC)** framework itself, which governs infrastructure deployment across all domains.
* **Traceability & Auditability:** Providing and managing the **Canonical Orchestrated Architecture File Index (COAFI)** and the **Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust (BITT)** systems, ensuring end-to-end traceability and immutable audit trails.
* **Federation Services:** Implementing and managing the core components required for federated identity management, policy synchronization, secure cross-domain communication, and data exchange.
* **Common Platform Services:** Hosting shared platform services such as core AI/ML model repositories, foundational data management services, monitoring and telemetry aggregation, and core security services (e.g., central IdP, secrets management).
* **Communication Protocols & Standards:** Defining and enforcing standards for inter-domain communication, APIs, and data formats to ensure compatibility.
* **Digital Ethics Framework Implementation:** Hosting and managing the operational aspects of the Digital Ethics framework (referenced in InaC Section 9), including potential central policy engines or AI ethics moderation services (e.g., AMEDEO).
* **Centralized Governance Tooling:** Providing tools and dashboards for monitoring compliance, security posture, and ESG metrics across the federated ecosystem.

## Key Components & Subdirectories

* **/InaC**: Contains the specifications, core code, policies, and documentation for the **Infrastructure-as-Conscious-Code** framework.
    * `GP-COM-INAC-TOC-A.md`: The master Table of Contents for the InaC specification.
    * *(Other InaC specification documents)*
* **/COAFI**: Documentation, APIs, and potentially core service implementation for the **Canonical Orchestrated Architecture File Index**.
* **/BITT**: Details on the **Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust** implementation, including network configuration, smart contracts, and access protocols.
* **/Federation**: Specifications and components related to the **Federated Architecture** management.
* **/Services**: Deployment configurations and documentation for shared platform services (AI/ML, Monitoring, Security, etc.).
* **/Standards**: Definitions of communication protocols, API guidelines, and data format standards.
* **/Ethics**: Implementation details and policies related to the operational **Digital Ethics** framework.

## Interaction with Other Domains

GP-COM acts as a service provider and governance enabler for all other GAIA domains. Other domains consume services hosted by GP-COM (like COAFI, BITT, shared AI models) and adhere to the standards and governance frameworks (like InaC policies, communication protocols) defined and managed within GP-COM. The InaC framework, managed here, orchestrates the deployment and management of infrastructure *within* those other domains according to centrally defined (but potentially locally customized) rules.

## Contribution & Development

We welcome contributions to the GP-COM domain. To contribute:

* Review the existing documentation in relevant subdirectories to understand the current architecture and guidelines.
* Follow standard Git workflows: fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
* Engage with maintainers through issues and discussions to align on architecture, coding standards, and best practices.
* For questions, collaboration, or detailed discussions, please reach out via the official GAIA Platforms communication channels listed in the repository's main README or contact the domain maintainers directly.
