# üìú Cross-Domain Authorization Policies

*GenAI Proposal Status: This document is an AI-generated structured framework for the GAIA PLATFORMS Cross-Domain Authorization Policies. It represents a conceptual organization that requires expert review before implementation.*

---

## Introduction

The Cross-Domain Authorization Policies document outlines the policies and guidelines for managing authorization across different domains within the GAIA Platforms initiative. These policies ensure that access to resources and services is controlled and monitored, enabling secure and efficient operations across various domains.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Cross-Domain Authorization Policies is to provide a standardized approach for managing authorization within the GAIA ecosystem. This includes:

- **Access Control:** Ensuring that access to resources and services is granted based on predefined policies and rules.
- **Interoperability:** Enabling seamless integration with other systems and domains.
- **Scalability:** Supporting a wide range of authorization scenarios and volumes.
- **Traceability:** Providing end-to-end traceability for all authorization actions.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with defined policies and standards.

## Key Components

The Cross-Domain Authorization Policies are composed of several key components that work together to achieve their purpose:

- **Authorization Types:** Classification of authorization types based on their scope, nature, and priority.
- **Authorization Rules:** Predefined rules for granting and revoking access to resources and services.
- **Authorization Handlers:** Components responsible for processing specific types of authorization requests.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Tools and systems for monitoring authorization actions and logging relevant information.
- **Compliance and Traceability:** Mechanisms for ensuring compliance with policies and providing traceability for authorization actions.

## Authorization Types

The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the predefined authorization types included in the Cross-Domain Authorization Policies:

### Authorization Type 1: User Authorization

- **Description:** Authorization granted to individual users based on their roles and permissions.
- **Scope:** Limited to specific resources and services.
- **Priority:** High
- **Authorization Rules:** Grant access based on user roles and permissions.

### Authorization Type 2: System Authorization

- **Description:** Authorization granted to system components based on their functions and requirements.
- **Scope:** Limited to specific system resources and services.
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Authorization Rules:** Grant access based on system functions and requirements.

### Authorization Type 3: Application Authorization

- **Description:** Authorization granted to applications based on their functions and requirements.
- **Scope:** Limited to specific application resources and services.
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Authorization Rules:** Grant access based on application functions and requirements.

## Authorization Rules

The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the predefined authorization rules included in the Cross-Domain Authorization Policies:

### Authorization Rule 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Description:** Grant access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Identify User Role:** Determine the role of the user based on their credentials.
  2. **Grant Access:** Grant access to resources and services based on the user's role and permissions.
  3. **Monitor and Log:** Monitor the authorization process and log relevant information for traceability and compliance.

### Authorization Rule 2: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- **Description:** Grant access based on user attributes and context.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Identify User Attributes:** Determine the attributes of the user based on their credentials and context.
  2. **Grant Access:** Grant access to resources and services based on the user's attributes and context.
  3. **Monitor and Log:** Monitor the authorization process and log relevant information for traceability and compliance.

### Authorization Rule 3: Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)

- **Description:** Grant access based on predefined policies and rules.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Identify Policy:** Determine the applicable policy based on the authorization request.
  2. **Grant Access:** Grant access to resources and services based on the predefined policy and rules.
  3. **Monitor and Log:** Monitor the authorization process and log relevant information for traceability and compliance.

## Compliance and Traceability

Ensuring compliance and traceability is a critical aspect of the Cross-Domain Authorization Policies. The following mechanisms are implemented to achieve this:

- **Unique Traceable IDs (UTidS):** Assigning unique IDs to all authorization actions for end-to-end traceability.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintaining comprehensive audit trails that document all authorization actions.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring compliance with defined policies and standards.
- **Reporting:** Generating reports on authorization actions and compliance status.

## Conclusion

The Cross-Domain Authorization Policies provide a comprehensive framework for managing authorization within the GAIA Platforms initiative. By implementing these policies, GAIA Platforms can ensure secure and efficient access control, seamless integration, scalability, traceability, and compliance with defined policies and standards.
